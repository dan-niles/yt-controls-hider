# YouTube Controls Auto-Hider

This is a simple Chrome extension that hides the YouTube controls after a few seconds of inactivity when the video is paused. The controls will reappear when the video is played or when the mouse is moved. This extension is useful for taking screenshots of paused videos without the controls getting in the way.

The controls can be manually hidden by pressing the Ctrl + M / Cmd + M keyboard shortcut.
